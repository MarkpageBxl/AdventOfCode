= Advent of Code solutions

Solutions repository for the Advent of Code challenges.

== Introduction

2024 is my very first experience with Advent of Code, so I'm clearly
not competitive on the global leaderboard. Enjoying myself greatly all
the same!

Since I accidentally solved a problem for 2015 at one point, I figured
this repo could contain solutions for all AoC editions.

== Ethics

I deliberately choose not to use any AI-based tools such as Copilot,
ChatGPT or Mistral/Codestral. I aim to put my own skill set, including
documentation searches, to the test.

== Languages

=== Python

Python is by far my favourite scripting language, the one with which I can
yield results the fastest, and a language I have taught at university. It
is thus my weapon of choice for these challenges.

I use Python with the following constraints to resolve the AoC challenges
(as of December 2024):

* Using the standard library and constructs available in Python 3.11
(or, alternatively, whatever Python version is shipped by default in
the current stable version of Debian GNU/Linux)

* No third party libraries (NumPy, etc.). To be fair, the standard
library is humongous already.
