= Advent of Code solutions

Solutions repository for the link:https://adventofcode.com/[Advent of
Code] (AoC) challenges.

== Introduction

2024 is my very first experience with AoC, and I'm clearly not competitive
on the global leaderboard. Enjoying myself greatly all the same!

Since I accidentally solved a problem for 2015 at one point, I figured
this repo could contain solutions for all AoC editions.

== Ethics

I deliberately choose not to use any AI-based tools such as Copilot,
ChatGPT or Mistral/Codestral. I aim to put my own skill set, including
documentation searches, to the test.

== Languages

=== Python

link:https://www.python.org/[Python] is by far my favourite scripting
language, the one with which I can yield results the fastest, and a
language I have taught at university. It is thus my weapon of choice
for these challenges.

I use Python with the following constraints to resolve the AoC challenges
(as of December 2024):

* Using the standard library and constructs available in Python 3.11
(or, alternatively, whatever Python version is shipped by default in the
current link:https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/[stable] version of
link:https://www.debian.org[Debian GNU/Linux])

* No third party libraries (NumPy, etc.). To be fair, the standard
library is humongous already compared to other languages, which is a
boon for AoC challenges.
