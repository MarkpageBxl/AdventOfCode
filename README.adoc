= Advent of Code 2024 solutions

Solutions repository for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

== Introduction

This is my very first experience with Advent of Code, so I'm clearly
not competitive on the global leaderboard. Enjoying myself greatly
all the same!

== Ethics

I deliberately choose not to use any AI-based tools such as Copilot,
ChatGPT or Mistral/Codestral. I aim to put my own skill set, including
documentation searches, to the test.

== Languages

Python is by far my favourite scripting language, the one with which
I can yield results the fastest, and a language I have taught at
university. It is thus my weapon of choice for these challenges.
